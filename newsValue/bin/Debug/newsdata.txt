Latest deadly shooting adds to spate of Chicago homicides|CHICAGO -- Two people opened fire at a Chicago gathering early Friday, killing one person and wounding seven others in the second such attack on the city's South Side in the past two weeks. According to police, two males opened fire at the “pop-up party” in the Ashburn neighborhood, killing a 26-year-old man who was shot in the head and leaving the wounded hospitalized in conditions ranging from fair to critical. The shooting followed a March 14 attack at another pop-up party in the Park Manor neighborhood a few miles east, where two people were killed and at least a dozen others were wounded. The fatal shootings appear to be picking up even after a year in which they jumped dramatically in Chicago, from 495 in 2019 to 769 in 2020. The city is on a pace to record even more this year: As of Wednesday, there had been 123 homicides in the city since Jan. 1, compared to 94 during the same period last year, according to the police department. There have also been more police officers shot or shot at. On Thursday, an alleged shoplifter at a Home Depot on the South Side shot a security guard and a police officer before he was killed in a shootout with police a short time later. The officer, who was shot in the shoulder and is expected to recover, is the fourth member of the department to be shot in the past two weeks and the 21st to be shot this year, compared to nine who were shot during the same period of 2020. Last year was one of the most dangerous for the city's police officers in memory, as 79 were fired upon, compared to 22 the year before. Police have struggled to explain the climbing totals, but at a press briefing Thursday, Police Superintendent David Brown, while talking about the officer who was shot at the Home Depot, suggested a connection between the shootings of officers and of civilians. “Men and women in law enforcement all across the country are under attack,” said Brown, who mentioned Eric Talley, the officer who was killed in Monday's mass shooting at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. “But here in Chicago ... it seems that these offenders are acting with impunity in the way not only do they shoot each other, but basically a loss of respect for law enforcement,” Brown said.
Mexico complains of mask-less tourists, closes ruin site|MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula complained Friday about tourists not wearing face masks, as Mexico braces for a surge of Easter Week visitors. The acting police chief of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo patrolled the streets of the resort of Tulum, reminding people to wear their masks and complaining about how few people did. “It is regrettable to see how undisciplined things have become," said Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez. "It was truly frustrating to see hundreds of people walking around without face masks,” noting that tourists were the worst offenders. “It really is embarrassing that we have to get to this point, of asking people (to wear masks), when we should be conscious of the risks we face,” he said. Federal authorities have decided to close the Chichén Itzá Maya ruin site in neighboring Yucatan state from April 1-4 to avoid the possible spread of coronavirus. The sprawling temple complex is Mexico's second most-visited archaeological site, and usually draws about 1.8 million visitors per year. And for the second year in a row, Latin America’s most famous re-enactment of the crucifixion of Christ will be held without spectators in Mexico City. The multi-day ceremony will be broadcast instead, The spectacle had drawn about 2 million spectators in recent years, but authorities said such big crowds would be too risky during the pandemic. The detailed performance has played out in the borough of Iztapalapa since 1843, but was closed to the public in 2020 for the first time in 177 years because of the virus. It was first performed in 1843 after a cholera outbreak threatened the then-rural hamlet.
Pfizer launches COVID vaccine trial for kids under 12|Pfizer now joins Moderna in testing its vaccine in younger children. The company will enroll 4,500 children in a trial that will ultimately include children as young as 6 months old. Previous trials have studied children ages 12 years and older. Experts say it's important to specifically test vaccines in children to ensure they are safe and effective in the youngest members of society -- so that ultimately everyone is eligible to receive a potentially life-saving vaccine. The trial is also important for protecting children from severe COVID-19 infection or complications from an infection, said Dr. Emmanuel Walter, chief medical officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Duke University is one of several medical centers participating in the Pfizer trial. Other vaccine manufacturers have also been hard at work moving to offer their vaccines to children. Moderna announced on March 16 that it would enroll 6,750 children ages 6 months to 12 years in a clinical trial. Johnson & Johnson has announced its intentions to develop trials for children. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca, which announced encouraging phase III trial results this week in the United States, has been studying children ages 6 and older in the United Kingdom since February.
NASA gives all clear: Earth safe from asteroid for 100 years|CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Whew, now here's some good cosmic news: NASA has given Earth the all clear for the next century from a particularly menacing asteroid. The space agency announced this week that new telescope observations have ruled out any chance of Apophis smacking Earth in 2068. That’s the same 1,100-foot (340-meter) space rock that was supposed to come frighteningly close in 2029 and again in 2036. NASA ruled out any chance of a strike during those two close approaches a while ago. But a potential 2068 collision still loomed. First detected in 2004, Apophis is now officially off NASA's asteroid “risk list.” “A 2068 impact is not in the realm of possibility anymore, and our calculations don’t show any impact risk for at least the next 100 years,” Davide Farnocchia of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said in a statement Friday.Scientists were able to refine Apophis' orbit around the sun thanks to radar observations earlier this month, when the asteroid passed within 10.6 million miles (17 million kilometers). Apophis will come within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) on April 13, 2029, enabling astronomers to get a good look. “When I started working with asteroids after college, Apophis was the poster child for hazardous asteroids,” Farnocchia said. “There’s a certain sense of satisfaction to see it removed from the risk list."
A 'not haunted' house hits the market in Boston area|BOSTON -- A Massachusetts woman noticed something strange about the “For Sale" sign outside a home in her neighborhood. On top of the sign with the name of the broker and their contact information was a sign with the words “Not Haunted" in big red letters. “This just went up around the corner and I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS,” Margot Bloomstein wrote in a tweet this week that included an image of the sign, The Boston Globe reported Thursday. The house is west of Boston but Bloomstein didn’t want to say exactly where to respect the homeowner’s privacy, she said. But she reached out to the real estate agency to learn more about the sign. They knew nothing about it either. The consensus is that the sign is a prank — maybe played by a ghost with a sense of humor.

Woman cries blood tears during menstruation in 'rare and unusual clinical case'| A young woman's menstrual cycle brought tears to her eyes. But unlike most period-related tears, hers were bright-red tears of blood. When the 25-year-old visited an emergency room with bloody tears oozing from both eyes, it was her second such episode in the past two months, doctors recently reported. Blood tears are a rare condition known as haemolacria, which can have different causes. In the woman's case, her eyes were otherwise normal and she wasn't ill or injured. However, both instances of bloody tears coincided with the onset of her period, the physicians wrote in a case report. Normal menstruation can sometimes trigger cyclical bleeding outside the uterus, known as vicarious menstruation. The woman's crimson teardrops likely represented a highly unusual convergence of two conditions — vicarious menstruation and haemolacria — leading to period-triggered tears of blood, according to the report.
